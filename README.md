# Big-Data

This project contains a set of small utilities for collecting and analysing
Bitcoin related data.  Python scripts live in the `src/` directory while
Jupyter notebooks are stored in `notebooks/`.  Example datasets are kept in the
`data/` folder.

## Setup

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Collecting data

Run one of the scripts from the repository root.  For example to collect market
prices every ten seconds:

```bash
python src/priceBitCoin.py
```

News data can be saved using:

```bash
python src/news.py
```

## Working with notebooks

Launch Jupyter to explore the notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA.ipynb
```

Any CSV or JSON files generated by the scripts are written to the `data/`
directory.

## Running tests

Install the project (optionally in editable mode) and run `pytest`:

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
pytest
```
